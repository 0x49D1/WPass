Version 4.2
Bugfixes:
<ul>
<li> Fixed Bug, which occurs by Sync a Database to Cloudstorage resulting in every time having a conflicted copy</li>

</ul>

New Features:
<ul>
<li> Optional AutoSync: Every Time the App is started, it looks now, if the Database in the Cloud is changed. If this is the Case, it gets the new Version. Optionally, AutoSync could be enabled only with WLAN</li>
<li> Optional Notification for Sync, so you could get notified after the Sync</li>
<li> Optionally Search in Password Fields</li>
<li> Since this new App is based on 7Pass, it gets the Base of the old Layout and Design, but really all Screens are now updated and overhauled to gain a easier access to all the old and new functions of the App</li>
<li> Properties Page for every Database. With this you could not only rename the DB locally, you could also change the Cloud Credentials or the URL (Specially for WebDAV and WebServer)</li>
<li> Timestamp of the Actual DB on every Page</li>
